        "Prognosis is a branch of medicine that specializes in predicting the future health of patients. For example, given a patient's labs results-- can we estimate the risks of having a heart attack over the next five or ten years. \n",
        "Machine Learning is a powerful tool for prognosis and can provide a temendous boost to this branch of medicine by using many different types of medical data to make accurate predictions about a patient's future health. \n",
        "Making prognosis is a clinically useful task for a variety of reasons. \n",
        "1.   **Risk of Illness** It is useful for informing patients the risk of develping an illness. There are blood tests that are used to estimate the risk of developing breasts and ovarian cancer.\n",
        "2.   **SUrvival with Illness** It is also used to inform patients how long they can expect to survive with a certain illness. Cancer staging gives an estimate of survival time of a patient with a particular type of cancer. \n",
        "\n",
        "Prognosis is also used for guiding treatment. In clinical practice, the prediction of a 10-year risk of heart attack is used to determine whether that patient should get drugs to reduce that risk. Another example is the **6-month mortality risk**. This is used for patients with terminal conditions that have become advanced and uncurable and it is used to determine who should recieve end-of-life care. \n",

        "*   Physical Examinations -- includes vital signs such as temperature and blodd pressure. \n",
        "*   Labs and imaging -- inlcudes blood work and CT scans, etc. \n",

The CHADS VASC model is used to calculate the one year risk of stroke for patients with AF.

Now, to evaluate these risks scores we need to know whether the patients actually had the event.

A good prognostic model should give patient A a higher score than to patient B. \n",

        "\n",
        "One major challenge when bulding decision trees is that if we don't stop growing the decision trees, they continue to create more and more partitions and they can get overly complex. Decision models can create overly complex trees that fit the training data almost prefectly! This ends up being a bad thing adn it is known as ***overfitting***. The model fits the data so well that is unable to generalize other samples or real-world data. \n",
        "One way to combat overfitting is to control when we stop growing the trees. We cna control this by setting the maximum depth the tree can grow to. Another popular way to combat overfitting is y building a ***Random Forest***. \n",

        "### Random Forests \n",

        "Random Forests construct multiple decision trees and average their risk predictions. \n",
        "How can a random forest be trained? There are two key concepts when training a random forests. \n",
        "1.   Each tree in the forest is constructed using a random sample of the patients. For instance, for the 1st tree, we might draw P1, P2 & P1 which can happen because the random forest samples with replacement.\n",
        "2.   The random forest algorithm also modifies the splitting procedure in the construction of the decision tree such that it uses a subset of features when creating decision boundaries. \n",
        "\n",
        "Random Forests generally boost the performance over single trees. With a single decision tree we might get a test accuracy of 0.71 with a random forest of 100 trees we can get an accuracy of 0.76. \n",
        "\n",
        "Random Forests are called an ***ensemble*** learning method because they use multiple decision trees to obtain better prediction performance than could be obtain from any of the decision trees alone. \n",
