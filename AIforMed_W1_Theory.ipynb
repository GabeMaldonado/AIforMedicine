The network can then be further trained using chest X-rays to indentify the presence or absence of diseases. In simply terms, having the network train on general images allows it to learn general features that can then help it learn on medical tasks. For instance, the features that it learned when identifying the shape of a penguin can be used to identify the edges of a lung. When we transfer these learned features to a new network, it can then learn how to interpret an X-ray with a better starting point. \n",
